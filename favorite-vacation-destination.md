# My Favorite Vacation Destination

### Sunriver, Oregon
I must admit that prior to my first experience with Sunriver I expected it to be pretty awful. The idea of traveling to a resort in central Oregon to experience the outdoors in luxury seemed sort of antithetical and somewhat offensive. "The outdoors is all around us," I thought. "Why travel and pay money to do something that you could and should do for free?"

I was incredibly wrong. Sure, there is a bit of bourgeois sensibility to the place and it certainly isn't somewhere you can go without a decent amount of disposable income, but once you get past the guilt it becomes a lot of fun. Especially if people-watching is something you enjoy.

In my first weekend there I was able to:
* Hike
* Bike
* Golf
* Kayak
* Visit an observatory
* Ride a horse
* Go to restaurants and a brewery
* Still manage to go into Bend, OR for more of the same

The part that was hardest to get past was how everything cost money. It takes a bit of time to realize  that it all costs money so you didn't have to deal with the inconvenient parts of having fun. Wanna go rafting? No problem! Pay a little money and:
1. Someone takes the raft to the water and loads it up for you.
2. You get in and do some rafting.
3. When you're done, someone takes the raft out of the water, loads it up on a trailer, and takes you back to your car.

All the other, tedium of going rafting is done. You only focus on the good parts.
